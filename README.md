# Task-Distribution---Operating-Systems

Distributing the tasks of a system to other systems and getting back the results from the systems. It reduces the time taken by the server system to perform tasks.

Two tasks (Linear Search and Optimal page fault algorithm) are sent to two clients and they are executed on the client systems and the output is sent back to the server. Here, the executable C file is considered as a 'task'.
